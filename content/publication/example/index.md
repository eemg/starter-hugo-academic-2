  With the successes of the laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory,
  we anticipate increased interest in working with squeezed states in the
  undergraduate and graduate quantum-mechanics classroom. Because
  squeezed-coherent states are minimum uncertainty states, their wavefunctions
  in position and momentum space must be Gaussians. But this result is rarely
  discussed in treatments of squeezed states in quantum textbooks or quantum
  optics textbooks. In this work, we show three different ways to construct the
  wavefunction for squeezed-coherent states: (i) a differential equation-based
  approach; (ii) an approach that uses an expansion in terms of the
  simple-harmonic oscillator wavefunctions; and (iii) a fully operator-based
  approach. We do this to illustrate that the concept of the wavefunction can be
  introduced no matter what methodology an instructor wishes to use. We hope
  that working with the wavefunction will help demystify the concept of a
  squeezed-coherent state.
